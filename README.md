# react-responsive-youtube-player

This project serves as an example of how to create a responsive youtube video player component that can be re-used as required. The player includes the following options:

- autoplay
- controls
- end
- fullscreen
- loop
- start
- width
- youtubeId

When you embed a youtube video it will not be responsive, which could be undesirable or even not feasible for your application. This is because iframes canâ€™t keep its ratio by itself as the domain is a third party, you are not allowed to know the content of the iframe for security and privacy reasons.

To mitigate this issue, we can wrap the embedded iframe in a div and have the iframe scale appropriately maintaining a 16:9 ratio, according to the size of its parent.

The player component receives a width as one of its properties. By using a % as the value for width, will allow the player to adjust to the size of its parent. For a fixed player size, use px.

In this project, the responsive youtube player component is used to build a responsive video gallery using flexbox.
